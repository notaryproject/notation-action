        You can sign multiple target artifacts by putting each reference on its 
        own line:

        ```yaml
        target_artifact_reference: |-
          <registry_1>/<repo_1>@<digest>

      if 'true', use the [Referrers API](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md#listing-referrers) to store signatures in the registry, 
      if Referrers API is not supported, automatically fallback to the [Referrers tag schema](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md#referrers-tag-schema);
      if 'false', use the Referrers tag schema by default.
      When set to 'true', it requires the 'NOTATION_EXPERIMENTAL=1' environment variable.
